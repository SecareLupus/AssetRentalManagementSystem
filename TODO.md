# Rental Management System - Milestone VII Roadmap

This milestone focuses on cleaning up temporary assumptions, fleshing out our interaction models, and cleaning up the UI for presentation.

## Future Plans

- [ ] **Multi-Facility Synchronization**: Global inventory visibility across geographically distributed sites.
- [ ] **AI-Driven Logistics**: Predictive maintenance and automated reordering based on utilization trends.
- [ ] **Third-Party Logistics (3PL) Integration**: Connect with shipping partners for automated dispatch.
- [ ] **MQTT Command Ingest**: Allow MQTT-connected clients to submit `RentAction` requests or control devices directly.
- [ ] **Mobile Technical Persona**: Native-like mobile experience for technicians performing inspections on-site.
- [ ] **Offline Mode**: Support for `RentAction` creation and `Kiosk` scanning in low-connectivity environments.
